To upgrade, upload all the files like you did in the original install and run upgrade.sql from the SQL folder.

Either don't upload the hibbity folder, or edit your config files after overwriting them.

Also, run install.php in the hibbity folder on your server. It'll make sure you've got the folders you need.
